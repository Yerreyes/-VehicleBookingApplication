# Vehicle Booking Application

This project is a desktop application developed in C# with Windows Forms, as part of the Advanced Programming course. The application simulates a vehicle booking system for different branches, using a client-server architecture where multiple clients connect to a centralized server to make and manage reservations. I made a conection with database which store all the information relevant with the sucursals and the clients.

**Main Features:**
- **Client-Server Architecture:** The application is divided into a client part and a server part. Clients connect to the server to perform queries and operations on the centralized database.

- **Using Sockets for Real-Time Communication:** It implements sockets for bi-directional communication between the client and the server. Sockets allow efficient and real-time communication, crucial for data synchronization and reservation management between multiple clients and the central server.

- **User Manual:** A detailed user manual is provided within the repository, guiding users on how to configure and use the application correctly.
